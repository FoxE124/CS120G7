In this screen the game will be played

There will be a picture of a world map with a black lines dividing each country's
borders
Below this picture there will be a text box prompting the user to enter their guess.

Upon entering a legitimate country into the prompt, the game will light up that country
with a colour ranging from blue to red, with blue showing the user is far away from the answer
and more red showing that they are getting closer.

The user will continue to guess until they guess the country until they are correct, and
then they will be directed to the game over screen.
